==== SHRINKWRAP README FILE =====

Shrinkwrap is a script I wrote as a companion to Flashbake -- a fabulous Python program that does 
version control for writers (https://github.com/commandline/flashbake). Shrinkwrap is a bash script
that gets the total word count for all top-level items in a folder and appends it to a log file --
then runs Flashbake and pushes changes to a remote repo (by default, this can be disabled).

On subsequent runs, it subtracts the old count from the new, giving you the total amount of words
you've written in a day.


## SETUP
All you have to do is add a list of your Flashbake folders to the "folders" file in Shrinkwrap's
directory, then, if you want, add a cron job (or edit your existing Flashbake one). 
Shrinkwrap creates hidden files for your current wordcount and wordcount log at
.wcCurrent and .wordCountLog.

If you don't use a remote repo to keep your stories backed up, disable the last line of the
do loop ("git push origin master").
